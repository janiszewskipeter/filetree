# Filetree

## Story

You are working at a company that develops UNIX maintenance software.
There's a program called _filetree_ which was developed years ago (and of course
the original developer has already left the company), and unfortunately, it is
buggy: it doesn't work as intended. Your job is to reveal and fix the bugs.

## What are you going to learn?

You will practice and learn about:
- code comprehension,
- debugging in Python,
- recursive functions.

## Tasks


1. Fix the program to properly print out filtered contents of the actual directory.

    - Running the program from the file's folder results in displaying the same contents on the console as in the `expected_outcome.txt`
    - The contents of the `expected_outcome.txt` is not hard-coded in the program


## General requirements


None

## Hints

- **Use the debugger!** It is really difficult to find these kind of bugs with just
reading the code. Step through the code multiple times, watch for variable
changes, try to examine the program in detail.
- Be careful, this program uses recursion at some point. It is sometimes difficult
to understand at first, so keep trying (and watch the movie _Inception_ ;) ).
